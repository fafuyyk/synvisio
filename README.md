# SynVisio
SynVisio is an interactive multiscale visualization tool that lets you explore the results of McScanX a popular synteny and collinearity detection toolkit.

SynVisio lets you explore the results of McScanX a popular synteny and collinearity detection toolkit and DAGChainer.

### SynVisio requires two files to run:
- The simplified gff file that was used as an input for a McScanX query.
- The collinearity file generated as an output by McScanX for the same input query.

SynVisio offers three basic types of visualizations a *Linear bar plot* a *Hive plot* and a *Dot Plot*. 

General information regarding the parameters that were set for McScanX and the percetage share of collinear genes, are read from the collinearity file and displayed along with the plots. Users can choose the source and the target chromosomes and the type of the plot using the options panel.

A demo video of the tool is available [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83ep_AuMWak)
